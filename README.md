# docker-tags-zig

![](docs/images/screen.png)

Search [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) tags. I made it using Zig.

```
 Usage: docker-tags [options] <IMAGE>...

 Description: Search for image tags from DockerHub

    -h, --help
            Display this help and exit.

    -v, --version
            Output version information and exit.

    -i, --with-image
            Connect and display image names and tags.

    -b, --browse
            Open the URL in the browser.

    -l, --limit <count>
            Limit the number of tags to display. (default: 30)

    -d, --detail
            Displays detailed information in table.

    <IMAGE>...
```

## usage

```bash
docker-tags node
docker-tags tensorflow/tensorflow -i # Image name and tag in combination, such as python:latest
docker-tags python -l 100 # Set the number of searches. default 30.
docker-tags python -b # Display the DockerHub page in your browser (Linux must be able to use xdg-open)
```

Basically, it appears as follows:

```
$ docker-tags node
lts-jod
lts-bullseye
lts-bookworm
lts
latest
...
```

### detail view

Use the `-d` option to display the table and see more detailed information.

```
$ docker-tags node -d

## with Docker CLI

It can be used as a docker cli plugin (v0.1.2~). That is, this tool can also be used as a subcommand of `docker`.

For example:

```bash
docker tags ubuntu -d
```

To use it as a plugin, place the `docker-tags` binary in the following location:

- `~/.docker/cli-plugins`

## env

- It is built for Windows, Linux x86_64, and MacOS aarch64.
- The author has only tested Windows and Linux builds.
- I have not done any code signing or anything else to the tool. Note that files in the release may be detected by virus scanning. I assume no liability whatsoever for the release files.
- Only publicly API accessible images are supported
- API endpoints use v2
- zig 0.13.0

## why did you create this?

With Zig, this is due to the motivation to make it cross-platform and small binary.
I created it by hand and am satisfied with its size of approximately 1000 KB, which is much smaller for my personal tool.
There are [several better similar tools](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockertags).

I hope that by making it open source, it will be useful to someone for something!

Zig is difficult for me as a beginner, but fun! üëç
